The build process builds three separate firmwares:

   * A RAM firmware which renumerates on startup
   * An EEPROM firmware which does not renumerate but does bootstrap the FPGA on startup
   * An EEPROM firmware which does not renumerate nor bootstrap the FPGA on startup

The bootstrap code is pretty inefficient, and could do with being optimised.
